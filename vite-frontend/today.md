This is just a markdown file where we put runnign notes for the day
- Maude shoudl be able to upload videos 
- In the early days we can't let our wanting this app interfere with people getting workouts in or we will have to keep rebuilding motivated clients which is a pain in the ass 
 - Just simplifying this process for clients will have value
 - I also feel a need to want to add complexity bc complexity is something people move towards as an avoidance tactic. 
 - Jan might be a good one for that 
 - - first question can Maude upload videos for each exercise right now 
 - Then can we send her feedback from her last video 
 - Then can she see the last workout performance on the current workout 
 - That will be enough if we can get that working today 
 - After that maybe we can see when people have compelted workouts - which we can but it would be ncie if we got sam tracking better 
 - Sam said he did cardio and he didn't see the value in tracking it. 
 - Who are the next people to onboard 
 - Jan, Pruthvi, Lucky, Jade 
 - boring shit 
   - need to clean up the git ignore and git files 
   - Sushil will need this 
   - plan to spend time on InCharge next week - updated time sheet. 
   - find a group online to help you build this app ? 
- Maude is doing a great job of usinig the app. 
- I need to be able as a coach to upload updated videos to her. today I had to oopen her workout, and add notes there. 
- It would be better if the size of the note would change default display size. 
- I want to predict the problems and solve them without seeing them but I have to be patient and let them show up first ? 
- I don't have enough data to solve it yet ? 
- WAtch videos review last workout give feedback generate new workout -
- Iteration cycle shyoudl be right aftrer workout and then next woprkout 
- I think thats why we lose 
- onboarding session over zoom ?
- Then design workout and load it up on tracker 
- have them do it once,  watch videos,  and track performance , then modify woirkout the workout and send it back to them 
- watch video send feedback goes to the nexts time they do this exercise ?
